## üß™ Lab Exercise: Configuring and Installing a Firewall

### Phase 1: pfSense Installation

1. **Download pfSense ISO**
   - Visit [pfSense.org](https://www.pfsense.org/download/)
   - Download the latest pfSense CE ISO image
   - Verify the checksum of the downloaded file

2. **Create Virtual Machine**
   - Allocate minimum 1GB RAM, 2GB recommended
   - Create virtual disk with 8GB minimum space
   - Configure 2 network adapters:
     - Adapter 1: NAT/Bridged (WAN)
     - Adapter 2: Host-only/Internal (LAN)

3. **Install pfSense**
   - Boot from ISO image
   - Follow installation wizard
   - Partition disk and install base system
   - Set root password

### Phase 2: Initial Configuration

1. **Network Interface Assignment**
   - Assign network interfaces during setup
   - Configure WAN interface (typically DHCP)
   - Configure LAN interface (static IP, e.g., 192.168.1.1/24)

2. **Web Interface Access**
   - Access pfSense web interface via LAN IP
   - Default: https://192.168.1.1
   - Login with admin/pfsense credentials

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Steps
